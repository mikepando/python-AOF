# Automate Outgoing Files with Python
This Python script sends a file as an attachment to an email address based on the filename.

### Requirements
You only need Python to run this script.
* [Python 3.8.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to Use
1. Modify the AOF.py file to fit your SMTP and email configuration.
2. This script creates email adresses based off the filename. All files must be in a ```First Last``` format. The email addresses format used is `First initial + Last name @ email.com`. A file named ```John Doe.docx``` would be rendered as ```JDoe@mail.com```
